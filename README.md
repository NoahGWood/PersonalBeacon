# PersonalBeacon
Personal Beacon is a key-fob sized emergency radio beacon designed to enable the location of persons trapped inside collapsed structures. When activated the personal beacon sends out an FM ping on the 30MHz frequency once per second, additionally the beacon includes a push-to-talk button and built-in microphone allowing for 1-way communication from an entrapped person. The estimated stand-by life of the device using CR2477 batteries is 8 years, during beacon-only operation the device is expected to last up to 17 days. During push-to-talk mode the device can be expected to last 12-24 hours. Additionally, charging circuitry is available for a larger (pocket-clipped) lithium-ion based beacons. The beacon is a very low wattage transmitter (~1/2 watt) which operates on the police/emergency band in the U.S. (30MHz) allowing the signal to be picked up by a handheld radio. The volume of the audible beacon on the receiver is directly proportional to the distance between the receiver and the beacon allowing first responders to use their handheld as effective dousing rods to locate entrapped persons.
